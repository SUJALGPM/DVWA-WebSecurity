## ‚ú® Why this repo

This repo documents a lab exercise (Experiment No.7) where DVWA was deployed in a controlled virtual machine, exploited to reveal vulnerabilities, and then hardened. It's built for learning ‚Äî clear evidence, repeatable PoCs, and practical remediation snippets make it ideal for students and instructors.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

* Complete DVWA LAMP setup commands (documented and masked for privacy).
* PoC exploits for: **SQLi, Reflected & Stored XSS, CSRF, IDOR, File Upload, Command Injection, LFI/RFI**.
* Remediation code snippets (prepared statements, output encoding, CSRF tokens, upload hardening).
* Evidence: labelled screenshots and terminal transcripts for reproducibility.
* Optional demo videos (2‚Äì4 min) for two chosen vulnerabilities.

## ‚ö° Quickstart ‚Äî Reproduce the Lab (summary)

> Full step-by-step is in `/notes/setup.md`. Use an isolated VM for safety.

```bash
# Install LAMP + extras
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y apache2 mariadb-server php php-mysqli php-xml php-gd php-mbstring git unzip
sudo systemctl enable --now apache2 mariadb
sudo mysql_secure_installation

# Install DVWA
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.git
sudo mv DVWA /var/www/html/dvwa
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/dvwa
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/dvwa
cd /var/www/html/dvwa/config
sudo cp config.inc.php.dist config.inc.php
# Edit DB creds, create DB and user, then visit http://<vm-ip>/dvwa/setup.php
```

## üî¨ Key Vulnerabilities & Example Remediations

* **SQL Injection (SQLi)** ‚Äî *PoC:* `exploits/sqli/`
  *Fix:* Prepared statements / parameterized queries + least-privilege DB account.

* **Reflected & Stored XSS** ‚Äî *PoC:* `exploits/xss_r/`, `exploits/xss_s/`
  *Fix:* Context-aware output encoding (HTML entity encoding), Content Security Policy (CSP).

* **CSRF** ‚Äî *PoC:* `exploits/csrf/`
  *Fix:* Per-request anti-CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies.

* **IDOR** ‚Äî *PoC:* `exploits/idor/`
  *Fix:* Server-side authorization checks; use opaque identifiers.

* **File Uploads** ‚Äî *PoC:* `exploits/upload/`
  *Fix:* Whitelisting, MIME + content validation, store outside webroot, rename files.

* **Command Injection / LFI / RFI** ‚Äî *PoC:* `exploits/exec/`, `exploits/fi/`
  *Fix:* Avoid shelling out, strict input validation, path canonicalization.

Detailed code examples are stored in `/patches/` and explained in the final `/report/`.

## üß≠ How to Explore the Exploits

1. Read the high-level description in `/exploits/README.md` for each vulnerability.
2. Reproduce PoC payloads inside an isolated VM running the supplied DVWA installation.
3. Capture screenshots and terminal transcripts; compare with `/evidence/` as reference.

---

## üì¶ Deliverables (for submission)

* `/report/Experiment07_Report.pdf` ‚Äî full report with executive summary, per-vuln evidence and CVSS-like risk ratings.
* `/evidence/` ‚Äî labeled screenshots and terminal transcripts.
* Git repo with code, PoCs, and optional short videos (2‚Äì4 mins) for selected vulnerabilities.

## üì∏ Screenshots & Evidence

All screenshots in `/evidence/` are labeled by vulnerability and step number. Sensitive information (IP addresses, real passwords) is masked. If you add evidence, follow the existing naming convention: `vuln-step-description.png`.
